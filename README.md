# Robot Path Planning Visualization
A testing ground for path planning strategies for ROS.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement D* Lite algorithm
- [ ] Write a script to generate fake map yaml and pgm based on double array 
- [ ] Implement more tests 
    - [ ] Yaml and pgm parsing
    - [ ] Test when the start or end point is invalid
    - [ ] Test when the max number of iterations is too small with RRT*
- [ ] Rewrite tests with GTest

## Dependencies
- CMake
- OpenCV

## Usage
This script requires the user to specify a yaml file for map information, the name of algorithm being used, and the start & end position. Certain algorithms require the user to specify the number of iterations to reduce the likelihood of an infinite loop (by default it is set to 10,000). If the map has thin or unexpected broken boudnaries it may also be benefitial to inflate their size to remedy this issue(by default boundaries are inflated by a 3x3 matrix). Look below for a more thorough breakdown of the possible commands for this script.
```
./rpp_viz -h

# Ouptut
Description: A simple script to test different path planning algorithms.
options: 
   -h, --help                            Show this help message and exit.
   -f FILE, --file FILE                  Provide map yaml filepath.
   -i INFLATE_SIZE. --inflate-size INFLATE_SIZE
                                         Set size of boundaries (Default: 3).
   -a ALGORITHM, --algorithm ALGORITHM   Set executed algoritm to one of the following: 
                                         [bfs, a-star, rrt-star, all].
   -l MAX_ITER, --max-iter MAX_ITER      Set limit the number of iterations executed.
                                         Only supported for sample-based methods (Default: 10000).
   -s START_POS, --start-pos START_POS   Set start position [Format: "int,int"].
   -e END_POS, --end-pos END_POS         Set end position [Format: "int,int"].
   -d, --debug                           Provide more information for debugging.
```

Example execution:
```
./rpp_viz -f "./maps/example1.yaml" -i 3 -a "rrt-star" -l 10000 -s "300,50" -e "381,360" -d
```

## Maps
Maps are based on a occupancy grid generated by the slam_toolbox ROS package. Therefore a yaml and pgm file are necessary to retreive the map data.
